#### Why we recommend this play
* Text messaging can be a low-cost but high-reward way to bolster communications:
  - It can supplement existing agency communications,
  - Get information out to many recipients quickly, and
  - It is relatively cheap
* Text messaging can reach more people, including those who are hard-to-reach:
  - Not everyone has reliable access to computers or smartphones to check websites, email, or mobile apps. Text messaging is more likely to reach those who have limmited technology access.
  - Not everyone has a mailing address. Text messaging is more likely to reach those who cannot receive mail.
  - Many are already familiar with, comfortable using, and may even prefer text messaging.
* Text messaging can be another way to check in with people and let them know that you care.

#### Best practices for this play
* Use empathy
* Use one-way text messaging to broadcast information to many people quickly
* Use two-way text messaging to do simple yes/no two-way communicating, such as for appointment confirmations.
