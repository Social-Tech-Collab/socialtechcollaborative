Before the COVID-19 emergency, many agencies administering social services programs were already adopting remote options to apply and enroll so that clients did not need to visit an office to do everything. During the COVID-19 emergency, it’s simply not possible to conduct business as usual if staff and clients are to be kept safe. Agencies need to make it possible for clients to do anything and everything needed to access programs without visiting an office. Policies for many of the programs people are relying on for basic needs are changing rapidly to make remote assistance possible, and these are only part of the effort needed to transition to completely remote assistance. This play provides guidance to agencies on how to use technology in ways to make this rapid transition smoother and more successful.

## Best practices for this play
In general:
* Take a “mobile first” approach to online remote assistance options. Design online options first and foremost for mobile devices because, for many people, their phone is the primarily or only way to access the internet - don’t assume that they have a computer.
* Use an Instant Messaging (IM) platform which allows clients to quickly communicate with an agency when they have a simple question or need basic information. 	
* Ensure that response times are much shorter for answering an instant message than answering a phone. Individuals are prepared to wait on hold when they reach a call center, but expect an immediate response to an instant message.
* Answer frequently asked questions with an online chatbot.
* Notify callers of expected wait times and offer a callback through an Interactive Voice Response (IVR) phone system.
* Expand functionality of a program’s online portal so program recipients can report changes and check benefit status themselves.
* Accept alternative forms of collecting signatures, such as electronic or telephonic signatures, for applications, renewals, and other forms.
* After an action is completed (e.g. an application is submitted or a document uploaded), provide the client with a confirmation on the screen and/or by email.
* Make sure that an online service works on all available browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, and Internet Explorer).
* Remind staff and clients to either delete personal information used on a mobile device (including tablets) if it is a shared device or to enable the device’s security features.
* See our play on [text messaging](../play-1/) best practices for further tips.

For interviews:
* Use the phone to conduct interviews or assessments (or waive the requirement).
* Enable on-demand scheduling via a program’s web portal or mobile app.
* Email or text appointment details in advance, including a checklist of documents needed and a list of interview questions.
* Send text message reminders before the interview time.
* If making outbound calls to clients, work with phone companies to be sure your agency name appears on the caller ID, rather than an unfamiliar number clients may not answer.
* Use a Live Chat feature for appointment rescheduling or cancellation.

For uploading documents:
* Provide through multiple channels an easy-to-understand checklist of which documents can be submitted as evidence for each eligibility requirement that documentation is required. Explain what to do if the client does not have the documentation needed.
* Allow clients to take a picture of documents with their smartphone and upload it to their case file through an online portal or mobile app.
* Give clients multiple ways to send documentation, such as via an online portal, via chatbot, via text messaging, etc.

For renewals:
* Text or email clients simple reminders (at different times) that their renewal is due and provide links to the forms, online portal, or call center where they can complete the renewal.
* Give clients multiple ways to answer renewal questions, such as over the phone, via an online portal, via chatbot, via text messaging, etc.
