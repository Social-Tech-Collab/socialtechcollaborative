Text messaging can be a low-cost but high-reward way to bolster communications, which is especially needed during a crisis. When done well, it can supplement existing agency communications, get information out to many recipients quickly, and make resolving questions and issues far faster and with less frustration. It is also relatively cheap compared to other communication methods.

Basic text messaging can maximize how many people are reached compared to other methods, such as mailed correspondence, emails, websites, or mobile apps. Not everyone has a mailing address to receive physical mail, but about 96% of Americans own a cellphone of some kind. Some cellphone users have more basic devices that cannot support email, mobile apps, or web browsing but do support text messaging. Lastly, some users are on limited usage plans and need to conserve calling minutes or smartphone data. Many are already familiar with, comfortable using, and may even prefer text messaging to communicate.

## Best practices for this play
Messages themselves should:
  - Be short (140 characters or less) so that they are not broken up over multiple text messages.
  - Use plain text instead of rich text or HTML.
  - Use a warm, affirming, and professional tone.
  - Use plain language free of jargon.
  - Indicate who it is from, to avoid suspicion that the message is spam.
  - Use the recipient’s ﬁrst name, which can improve response rates.
  - Be clear what the request or request is, if there is one.
  - Try to make questions easy to answer, such as by asking only simple yes/no questions.
  - Ensure any links are short and tested on mobile devices in advance.
  - Include other means to connect for follow-up questions.
  - Be proofread and tested before sending, especially if going out to many people.

One-way vs. two-way text messaging:
  - [One-way text messaging](https://www.codeforamerica.org/features/louisiana-demo/) is effective for short messages giving clients critical information or notifying them that basic action is required.
  - [Two-way messaging](http://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/codeforamerica-cms1/documents/Streamlining-Access-Report_Integrated-Benefits-Initiative-Civilla_Code-for-America_March-2019.pdf) is effective for anything in which back-and-forth communication is needed or would be helpful. It can be used for a variety of communication needs, including:
    - Gathering information,
    - Scheduling and confirming appointments, or
    - Resolving questions or issues.
  - No matter if one-way or two-way text messaging is used, ensure that there is always a response. If the communication is meant to be one way, or if it is meant to be two-way but staff are not able to reply quickly, send an automated response ensuring the sender that their message was received and what to expect next.

Show respect for users by:
  - Making it easy for users to opt in and out of text message communication.
  - Ensuring that text messaging protects users’ privacy and security, and be sure to let users know this as well.

Have a plan for how text messaging will be used. Create an electronic communications policy within your organization or agency outlining who, how, when, why, and for what text messaging will be used.

Not everyone will be able to communicate by text message. And others simply do not like using it for certain situations, or at all. Text messaging is ideally just one of many communication methods used.
