            <h2>About the playbook</h2>
            <p>The Social Services Response Playbook is designed for state, local, and nonprofit agencies to access practical and timely guidance to meet the overwhelming demand for basic needs such as food, health, and income assistance. In the wake of steps taken to protect public health during the COVID-19 pandemic, agencies have had to quickly change business operations in order to protect their staff, while still allowing them to provide help and support, as well as implement the new flexibilities in policy and procedures provided by changes in federal, state, and local policy. It is a collaborative effort from nonprofit and social impact organizations who are focused on leveraging technology, policy, design, and data expertise to transform the ways public-serving institutions deliver and manage social support and services.</p>
