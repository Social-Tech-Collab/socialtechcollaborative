            <h2>About the playbook</h2>
            <p>The Social Tech Playbook for COVID-19 Response is designed for state, local, and nonprofit agencies. It provides practical and timely guidance to help leaders meet the overwhelming demand for basic needs such as food, health, and income assistance. During the COVID-19 pandemic, agencies have had to quickly change business operations in order to protect their staff while continuing  to provide help and support to the community. Theyâ€™ve also had to quickly implement changes to reflect new federal, state, and local policies and procedures. Our playbook reflects  a collaboration between nonprofit and social impact organizations focused on leveraging technology, policy, design, and data expertise to transform the ways public-serving institutions deliver and manage social support and services.</p>
